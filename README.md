This program runs 25 trials of a genetic algorithm to find a solution to N Queens for n=12, as required by the assignment. Simply compile ("javac NQueens.java") and run ("java NQueens"), and results.txt will be generated in the root directory containing 25 lines, one line for each of the 25 trials. The line will contain the generation a solution was found, and the representation for that solution. If the algorithm reached the maximum generation (1000 as written, per the assignment), the maximum generation number will be printed with no solution after it. Solutions are represented as an array of integers, where each index is an x-position on the chess board. The value in a given index is the y-position on the board corresponding to that x-position.
